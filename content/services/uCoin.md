uCoin is an implementation of a Basic Income through cryptocurrencies. We call moneys issued by uCoin networks *Free moneys*. They respect the four economic freedoms as defined in the [Relative Theory of Money](http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/) : 

 * Freedom of democratic modification
 * Freedom to access to resources
 * Freedom of value production
 * Freedom of exchange “in the money”

*To a free economy*
